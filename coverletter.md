Reviewer: 1

> The title of the paper is OK but rather vague. It does not really describe the content of the paper, which is an application for viewing astronomical data. Instead, it refers to a more general concept that is motivating the work.
 
 Added "in astronomical visualization" to the title

> I do not see an abstract in the materials I was given.

Added the abstract in the main document in addition to the submission form that was not sent to the reviewers

> Here are some minor notes I have:

Thank you for the notes which we addressed in the manuscript

> Overall I like this paper very much. It is well written and describes what appears to be mature software. There is, however, one aspect where the paper (surely unintentionally) makes unsubstantiated claims. These need to be rectified before the paper is published in a technical journal like CG&A.
> The claims I am referring to come in the introduction to justify the work presented. The claim is that an interactive/immersive presentation will help a general audience learn better. This claim is stated as fact multiple times such as with "an evolutionary step in science communication" and "By including the general public in the process of scientific discovery it allows the audience to understand the underlying complexity and gain a deeper appreciation for the data collected" and "This will ultimately result in a better educated populous" and "Providing that information in a context which enables the public to understand" and "doing beats telling." This paper cannot make such a decisive claim without providing supporting information.

Tuned down the statement as desired by the reviewer and added an additional reference that shows the benefit of interactive media over static

> * I believe the system description would benefit from (very) brief overview preceding the detailed explanation of the components themselves.

Added a short description that provides a basic overview of the system.

> * Even given the information in the text and in its caption, I still found Fig 6 fairly hard to make sense of.

Changed the wording of the caption to make Fig 6 more understandable

> * On page 10 ln 56, I was wondering if the authors could clarify in how far the aspect raised here is related to their use of SPICE.

Added explanations to Rosetta highlighting why espetially this mission benefits from high resolution positioning and orientation information
