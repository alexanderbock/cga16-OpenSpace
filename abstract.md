We present the development of an open-source software called OpenSpace that bridges the gap between scientific discoveries and public dissemination and thus paves the way for the next generation of science communication and data exploration.  Targeting desktop computers to planetarium environments, we describe the platform's design and how it enables interactive presentations of dynamic and time-varying processes, by domain experts, to the general public.  The concepts are demonstrated through four cases: the New Horizions fly-by at Pluto, the image acquisition by the Rosetta spacecraft, the dissemination of space weather phenomena, and the display of high-resolution planetary images. Each case has been presented to a wide public audience through online events and with great success.  These cases highlight the details of data acquisition in astronomical domains, rather than simply presenting the final results, showing the audience the value of supporting the efforts of the scientific discovery.
