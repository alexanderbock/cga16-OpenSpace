Comments to the Author:
Both reviewers agree that this is a well-written, timely paper which describes a mature software in a fitting way. Apart from some minor revisions (see individual reviews for details), one reviewer pointed out that the claim to "better learning" made in the introduction might be a bit overstated and thus should be tuned down a little. Despite this not, the reviewers are confident that a minor revision will turn this into a very good publication.

Recommendation: Accept If Certain Minor Revisions Are Made

Comments:
The title of the paper is OK but rather vague. It does not really describe the content of the paper, which is an application for viewing astronomical data. Instead, it refers to a more general concept that is motivating the work.

I do not see an abstract in the materials I was given.

Overall, I like this paper. It is easy to read and provides an impressive demonstration of the OpenSpace software platform. This work will be of interest to the CG&A audience.

The paper is mostly fine as it is with the exception of adding qualifications to the claims about learning that I mentioned previously.

Here are some minor notes I have:

Page 1, line 46: "that scientists and educators [are] promoting and supporting"

Page 3, line 9: "the minimum value that can be added to a single precision floating point value, $v$, is $\approx 6 * 10^8 v." --> I think the paper means 6*10^-8 (negative exponent).

Page 9, line 35: "which made measurements of Pluto's atmosphere (see Figure 8)." --> Figure 8 does not show a demonstration of taking measurements of Pluto's atmosphere. Perhaps the paper means Figure 7, but that does not seem to have anything to do with the atmosphere either.

Page 11, line 11: "will then [be] used"


Additional Questions:
1. CG&A accepts manuscripts for different types of contributions. What category best describes this paper?: Application of research results

null: 

2. How appropriate is this manuscript for the readers of CG&A? You will be asked to explain your rating in the next question.: Very Relevant

3. Please explain your answer to question 2. If you feel the manuscript is relevant, please say why. If you do not feel it is relevant, or that it is not appropriate for CG&A, then please state why not. You can be brief, but please be specific. If it is out-of-scope and you can provide a recommendation for a better venue, please do so. If it presents a problem that is well solved by techniques already found in textbooks, or an application that is already commonly practiced, please provide a reference to a suitable textbook or application. If the manuscript is so poorly written you can not evaluate it, please state this and briefly state why (language, organization, etc.).: This paper describes a feature-rich graphical application and several examples of how it is being used. The paper focuses more on the description of the application than the research or novel creations engaged in it. I think this is a good example of a CG&A paper and I cannot think of another publication venue that would be more appropriate.

1. Please summarize what you view as the key contribution(s) of the manuscript.: This paper describes the implementation and features of a software program called OpenSpace, which provides an open platform for interactive planetary scenes. OpenSpace supports a variety of interaction modalities from desktop to VR to planetarium dome. Furthermore, the content of OpenSpace is highly configurable and capable of displaying data collected for various different aspects of our universe.

2. Is the manuscript technically sound? Please explain your answer in the Detailed Comments section.: Appears to be - but didn't check completely

3. What do you see as this manuscript's contribution to the literature in this field? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: No Comments

4. What do you see as the strongest aspect of this manuscript? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: No Comments

5. What do you see as the weakest aspect of this manuscript? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: Overall I like this paper very much. It is well written and describes what appears to be mature software. There is, however, one aspect where the paper (surely unintentionally) makes unsubstantiated claims. These need to be rectified before the paper is published in a technical journal like CG&A.

The claims I am referring to come in the introduction to justify the work presented. The claim is that an interactive/immersive presentation will help a general audience learn better. This claim is stated as fact multiple times such as with "an evolutionary step in science communication" and "By including the general public in the process of scientific discovery it allows the audience to understand the underlying complexity and gain a deeper appreciation for the data collected" and "This will ultimately result in a better educated populous" and "Providing that information in a context which enables the public to understand" and "doing beats telling." This paper cannot make such a decisive claim without providing supporting information.

To be clear, I am not disagreeing with the paper on this point. I'm willing to consider this as a true statement. However, as much intuitive sense as it makes, the best methods for teaching people is far from self evident. Even intuitive claims need to be substantiated.

Collecting evidence on effective teaching methods is a big, hard problem that is way outside of the scope of this paper. Fortunately, I believe the work on OpenSpace stands on its own and is not dependent on these claims. This paper can be easily corrected by qualifying these statements with phrases like "we believe" to make it clear that these statements are an assumption, not an verifiable fact. (Of course, if there is already established literature demonstrating these claims, then the paper could then instead reference them to make the claim.)

This is something of a minor detail to fix, but I feel it is a very important one before publication.

6. If this paper is an expanded version of a conference or workshop paper, is there 25% new material beyond the original publication? This must include new results or insights, not just additional description. If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: No Comments

7. If this paper describes an application, what problem does it solve and who are its intended users? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: The paper describes OpenSpace, a software framework for presenting astrophysical data from numerous different sources. The software is designed to be open and flexible so that it can be applied to view many different types of data with many different display environments to many different types of users. The paper establishes these capabilities by describing many different use cases in which OpenSpace has been leveraged. These use cases also provide the opportunity to showcase many of the features of OpenSpace such as large space viewing and navigation, terrain level of detail, image tiling, and irregular shape handling. There are several competing products that have similar capabilities, but I'm not aware of any that are so feature rich.

8. If this paper describes an application, does it provide non-trivial design and implementation insights for builders of similar systems? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: The paper does not provide any real detail on the software system itself; the software is probably too large for such an attempt to be meaningful. The paper does discuss some of the features it implements such as the scene graph, the display of celestial bodies at planetary, stellar, and galaxy scales, level-of-detail, and image projection. The details on these implementations are light, which will limit their use for builders of similar systems. But it does give a road map to the implementation used.

Reviewer: 2

Recommendation: Accept If Certain Minor Revisions Are Made

Comments:
Overall, this is a very good manuscript as it is. Its introduction clearly motivates the use case. The authors argue that visualization should not only be used to analyze data but also as a means to communicate how said data was generated in the first place. This is a fresh view that I consider highly relevant, specifically in the given setting of astrophysics. The manuscript is well-structured and well-written; as such, it is easy to follow. The included case studies provide a clear indication of the underlying system's versatility and the resulting impact. 

There are a few smaller issues which I would like to see addressed in a minor revision.

* I believe the system description would benefit from (very) brief overview preceding the detailed explanation of the components themselves.

* Even given the information in the text and in its caption, I still found Fig 6 fairly hard to make sense of.

* On page 10 ln 56, I was wondering if the authors could clarify in how far the aspect raised here is related to their use of SPICE.

3. Please explain your answer to question 2. If you feel the manuscript is relevant, please say why. If you do not feel it is relevant, or that it is not appropriate for CG&A, then please state why not. You can be brief, but please be specific. If it is out-of-scope and you can provide a recommendation for a better venue, please do so. If it presents a problem that is well solved by techniques already found in textbooks, or an application that is already commonly practiced, please provide a reference to a suitable textbook or application. If the manuscript is so poorly written you can not evaluate it, please state this and briefly state why (language, organization, etc.).: The paper describes an innovative solution for the visualization of astrophysical data. The author's focus is on enabling the communication of data in context, i.e. not only showing the data itself but also how it was acquired. This is highly relevant because on the one hand it enables scientists to clearly communicate "how science is made" while on the other hand the added context may help analysts gleaning new insights from the data.

1. Please summarize what you view as the key contribution(s) of the manuscript.: The key contribution here is the description of the OpenSpace platform as a whole, including its core components. This goes along with a description of four use cases that demonstrate the system's practical value.

2. Is the manuscript technically sound? Please explain your answer in the Detailed Comments section.: Yes

3. What do you see as this manuscript's contribution to the literature in this field? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: see above

4. What do you see as the strongest aspect of this manuscript? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: First, the proposed system opens up a host of opportunities with regard to the intended use case of visualizing data related to celestial dynamics in context. The selected use cases provide a good understanding of the range of problems that can be covered.
Second, the target audience and hence the potential impact is large. The proposed system has been used to communicate a "live" mission to thousands of users in real-time. This is a claim that few visualization solutions can make and it stands to demonstrate the relevance of the development work underlying this paper.

5. What do you see as the weakest aspect of this manuscript? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: This is a very good manuscript to begin with. Some minor issues are detailed below.

6. If this paper is an expanded version of a conference or workshop paper, is there 25% new material beyond the original publication? This must include new results or insights, not just additional description. If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: not applicable

7. If this paper describes an application, what problem does it solve and who are its intended users? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: As described, OpenSpace can be used to visualize (almost) arbitrary dynamics of celestial bodies. The potential target user group is vast, covering interested laymen, mission planners, and researchers in astrophysics alike.

8. If this paper describes an application, does it provide non-trivial design and implementation insights for builders of similar systems? If you don't have any comments, please type No Comments.: The authors outline several of the core components of the OpenSpace system. It is interesting to see that not everything has been implemented from scratch, e.g. OpenSpace integrates the existing SPICE library for the accurate positioning of celestial bodies. The use of this library is well motivated. In contrast, OpenSpace covers several aspects that are related to the actual rendering of the underlying scenes internally. The discussion clearly communicates a significant amount of attention to detail which makes it valuable as a template for similar projects.
